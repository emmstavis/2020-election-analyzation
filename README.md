This is a personal project I completed in 2020 trying to find counties that would determine the 2020 election.

find_counties_to_flip does this data analyzation, and get_2016_data is a simple program that I created for election night to compare 2020 returns as they came in to 2016 results in swing states. 

These were both designed to be fun, personal programs, so optimization was not heavily prioritized.
